                  <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-6">Every full moon night, Yogiraj encourages us to sit for Earth Peace meditations at our individual homes anytime between the hours of 7 to 10pm local time. During the meditation session, there is a direct spiritual transmission from the Master. While experiencing “Still Mind”, humanity can experience oneness with the Creator, greater peace, and love. This great peace and love then can be released into all the world through the Earth Peace Meditation which utilizes group energy through chanting simple vowel sounds, visualization and intention.</p>
                  <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-6">You may learn Yogiraj’s Earth Peace Meditation technique through the video above, or if you’d like to learn in person, contact your nearest Hamsacharya (teacher).
