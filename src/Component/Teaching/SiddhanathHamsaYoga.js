                    Shakti Healing 
                    </li>
                    <p class="text-lg mt-6">Shakti means “Siddhanath Healing and Kundalini Transmission In-depth.” Shakti is an inner journey of awakening Kundalini Energy & cleansing the chakras. It brings about a total transformation which recuperates the body and connects one to the ultimate source of all healing. In this practice, Siddhanath has given special kumbhaks and visuals to accentuate one’s evolutionary thrust. The Shakti healing also includes precious mantras and hands on techniques for chakra surgery & integrating around a higher center of consciousness.</p>

From it proceeds all sounds and mantras of Shakti Healing Enlightenment. Solve your problems by learning the suitable mantras, and the corresponding whirls with seed sounds.</p>
