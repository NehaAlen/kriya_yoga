              What is Kundalini Kriya Yoga – Pran Apan Yagya
            </h2>
            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              There never has been or will be a time when man’s own nature shall
              cease to demand his best and foremost attention. The science of
              Yoga commends itself to the foremost minds of east and west. So
              vital is this inner science for the evolution of human
              consciousness that besides it the greatest of human achievements
              pale into insignificance.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              The science of Kundalini Kriya Yoga pranayam offers the inhaled
              pranic breath into the exhaled apanic breath and vice versa. By
              this process the yogi neutralizes the two life currents of pran
              and apan. This results in the arresting of decay and growth in the
              body. This is done by rejuvenating the blood and body cells with
              life energy (prana) that has been distilled from the breath and
              moved into the spine and the brain. The Kriya yogi arrests all
              bodily decay, thereby quieting the breath & heart. This renders
              the purifying actions of the breath and heart unnecessary as they
              gradually slow down through persevering practice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              The Bhagavad Gita makes a mention of this science in chapter 4
              verse 29. The Kundalini Kriya Yoga pranayam called the pran-apanic
              fire rite by the Yogis, teaches man to untie the cord of breath
              that binds our soul to the bodily cage. Thus releasing the soul to
              fly & expand into the superconscious skies of omnipresent spirit
              and come back at will into the little body cage. No flight or
              fancy this but a true experiencing of divine bliss.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              Pranayam is derived from its Sanskrit roots, Prana (life) and
              Ayama (control). So Pranayama is therefore life-force control and
              not breath control. In the larger sense the whole world is filled
              with the universal life-force energy called Prana. Everything is a
              differentiation of the modes of expression of this universal
              force. Therefore universal Prana is Para-Prakriti (pure Nature).
              This eminent energy is derived from the infinite spirit and
              permeates and sustains the universe

              Individual Prana is an intelligent force but has no consciousness
              in the empirical nor transcendental sense. The Soul is the
              conscious unit and Prana is its basis. The consciousness through
              mind ego dictates terms and prana follows the dictate. Neither
              grossly material nor purely spiritual prana borrows from the soul
              its power of activating the body.

            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              There are two main currents in the body. One is that of prana
              which flows from the coccyx to the point between the eyebrows. The
              nature of this life is current is soothing;

              In introverts the devotees attention during sleep and the wakeful
              state, and in meditation unites the soul with the spirit in the
              third ventricle of the brain called the Shivanetra third eye.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              The other main current is that of apana which flows from the third
              eye to the coccyx.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              The apana current is restless and engrosses man in sensory
              experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left md:text-lg text-gray-700 px-2">
              (Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6 verse 46) “Greater is the Yogi than body
              disciplining ascetics, greater even than the followers of wisdom’s
              path. Greater than the path of action. Be thou Arjuna a Yogi!

              Kundalini Kriya Yoga pranayama arrests bodily decay connected with
              apana, manifest in the exhaling breath, by fresh inhalations of
              life-force (Prana) distilled from the inhaling breath. This prana
              enables the devotee to do away with the illusion of decay &
              mutation; he then realizes that his body is made of lifetrons of
              congealed light. The body of the Kriya Yogi is recharged with
              extra energy distilled from the breath and energized by the
              tremendous dynamo of energy generated in the spine, the decay of
              body tissues decreases.
