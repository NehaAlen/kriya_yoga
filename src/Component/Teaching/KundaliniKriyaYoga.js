          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5 ">There never has been or will be a time when man’s own nature shall cease to demand his best and foremost attention. The science of Yoga commends itself to the foremost minds of east and west. So vital is this inner science for the evolution of human consciousness that besides it the greatest of human achievements pale into insignificance.</p>
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">The science of Kundalini Kriya Yoga pranayam offers the inhaled pranic breath into the exhaled apanic breath and vice versa. By this process the yogi neutralizes the two life currents of pran and apan. This results in the arresting of decay and growth in the body. This is done by rejuvenating the blood and body cells with life energy (prana) that has been distilled from the breath and moved into the spine and the brain. The Kriya yogi arrests all bodily decay, thereby quieting the breath & heart. This renders the purifying actions of the breath and heart unnecessary as they gradually slow down through persevering practice.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">The Bhagavad Gita makes a mention of this science in chapter 4 verse 29. The Kundalini Kriya Yoga pranayam called the pran-apanic fire rite by the Yogis, teaches man to untie the cord of breath that binds our soul to the bodily cage. Thus releasing the soul to fly & expand into the superconscious skies of omnipresent spirit and come back at will into the little body cage. No flight or fancy this but a true experiencing of divine bliss.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Pranayam is derived from its Sanskrit roots, Prana (life) and Ayama (control). So Pranayama is therefore life-force control and not breath control. In the larger sense the whole world is filled with the universal life-force energy called Prana. Everything is a differentiation of the modes of expression of this universal force. Therefore universal Prana is Para-Prakriti (pure Nature). This eminent energy is derived from the infinite spirit and permeates and sustains the universe</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Individual Prana is an intelligent force but has no consciousness in the empirical nor transcendental sense. The Soul is the conscious unit and Prana is its basis. The consciousness through mind ego dictates terms and prana follows the dictate. Neither grossly material nor purely spiritual prana borrows from the soul its power of activating the body.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">There are two main currents in the body. One is that of prana which flows from the coccyx to the point between the eyebrows. The nature of this life is current is soothing;</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">In introverts the devotees attention during sleep and the wakeful state, and in meditation unites the soul with the spirit in the third ventricle of the brain called the Shivanetra third eye.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">The other main current is that of apana which flows from the third eye to the coccyx.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">The apana current is restless and engrosses man in sensory experiences.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">(Bhagavad Gita, chapter 6 verse 46) “Greater is the Yogi than body disciplining ascetics, greater even than the followers of wisdom’s path. Greater than the path of action. Be thou Arjuna a Yogi!</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Kundalini Kriya Yoga pranayama arrests bodily decay connected with apana, manifest in the exhaling breath, by fresh inhalations of life-force (Prana) distilled from the inhaling breath. This prana enables the devotee to do away with the illusion of decay & mutation; he then realizes that his body is made of lifetrons of congealed light. The body of the Kriya Yogi is recharged with extra energy distilled from the breath and energized by the tremendous dynamo of energy generated in the spine, the decay of body tissues decreases. This ultimately makes unnecessary the blood cleansing functions of the heart. The heart pump becomes quiet owing to the non-pumping of venous blood and exhalation & inhalation of breath are evened out. The life energy unites in the currents in the spine. The light of pure prana scintillates from the six charkas to all the bodily cells keeping them in a spiritually magnetized condition.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Kundalini Kriya Yoga is referred to obliquely in yoga treatises as Kevali pranayama or Kevali Kumbhaka. This is the true pranayama that has transcended the necessity for inhalation (puraka) and exhalation (Rechaka); breath is transmuted into inner life-force currents, under the complete control of the mind. When the breath stops effortlessly without either rechaka or puraka that is Kevali Kumbaka. (Hatha Yoga Pratipika II-73). Of the various stages of pranayama (ie breathlessness), Kevali is extolled by adept Yogis as the best or highest (NB Kundalini Kriya Yoga is not breath control but lifeforce control). When one get to the advanced state of Shiva Shakti Kriya; the breath ceases. Duly the cool ascending pranic current & warm descending apanic current are felt flowing in the sushumna nadi (spinal cord). This is an avasta (state) of Kevali Kumbaka.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Though in principle it may be equated with Kundalini Kriya Yoga, Kevali pranayama is not as explicit as the specific Kundalini Kriya Yoga science and techniques expounded by Shiv Goraksha Babaji, the Mahavatar.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">(Gita pg 306 Vol I, Yogananda) “The Lord surrounded mans soul first with an idea body. Then he encased the idea body with a very subtle light, the astral body. The third or final encasement was the electroatomic dream body, the illusion of a fleshly form. The Gita advises us to practice pranayama (Life-force control) to enable us to realize that we are not made of flesh; but of life-force condensed from the thought of God!.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Electro-Lifetronic – Sattva Guna – Luminosity – Ananda Kosh – Causal body.</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Electro Protonic – Rajo Guna – Activity – Mano Vaigymic – Astral body</p>    
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Electro Atomic – Tamo Guna – Inertia – Physical body.</p> 
          <p class="text-lg text-start px-5 md:px-0 mt-5">Kundalini Kriya is a process of converting breath into life-force and realizing the body as light. By the perfect performance of Kriya 1,728 times in one posture (ie at one time) and by practicing 20,736 Kriyas a devotee can reach a state of Samadhi (God contact). But Kriya cannot be practiced so many times by a beginner. When the body & mind of the Yogi are prepared to accommodate the high voltage of so much Kundalini Kriya Yoga, his Guru will advise him that he is ready for the experience of Samadhi. If the Kriyas are broken into several sittings no harm; it will just take longer.</p>
